# c89-continuous-integration

## Compile

Run `gcc math.c main.c -o main.exe` command to compile without any other option and sugar. In makefile, I use also `-Wall -Wextra -std=c89 -pedantic` to force all warnings, extras too, and use the c89 language dialect.

## Test

Run `./test.sh` and wait for the results.
