# Contribute to C89-CONTINUOUS-INTEGRATION

There's is not a lot to contribute on this project in term of new features, since I wanna took this project as small as possible.

> Make each program do one thing well. Or almost.

## Documentation

This section includes any help you need with the documentation and where it can be found. Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it.

## Contribute

I encourage all contributions to this repository! Open issues and pull requests. All interactions here should conform the peaceful coexistence (don't be aggressive, I don't wanna add also a code of conduit file at the moment).
